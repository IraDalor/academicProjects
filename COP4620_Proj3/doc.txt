Lex and YACC

This is a straightfoward implementation of a given grammar for SQL queries
using LEX and YACC tools. LEX functions to ensure only tokens acceptable to
the given language are used and YACC uses the grammar given to check the
syntax of the given input. The make command is used to produce an executable
as well as supporting .c and .o files. The user can then run the program using
the executable with a file to be read by the program as a parameter. The
program will simply print ACCEPT or REJECT based on the contents of the file.
REJECT may be printed for either tokens outside of the language, determined
by LEX, or due to a syntax error, found by YACC.
