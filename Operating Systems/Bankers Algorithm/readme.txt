Specifications for the Bankers algorithm project are as follows, the project worked as expected per specification:

Write a program to implement the Bankerâ€™s Algorithm as described on pages 344-345 of your text book. Test the program as specified.

Include your program along with output showing it run correctly for one case where the bank grants a request by satisfying the safety 
algorithm (section 7.5.3.1) and for one case where the bank denies a request since the request does not leave the system in a safe state.
