This is a parser that works in conjunction with the lexical analyzer to 
determine if a given file contains C- tokens written in the proper order. 
The parser functions based on a provided grammar for C- that has been 
modified to function properly in the application of a LL(1) type parser 
by removing left recursion and left factoring that would otherwise cause 
the parser to loop endlessly. Each rule has been implimented as a function 
that calls the next approprite function based on the symbol observed. The 
parser must have the lexical anaalyzer present in the same file in order 
to receive tokens from the file given. In order to use the parser one need 
only call its script, named p2, with a text file given as a parameter. The 
parser will simply print "ACCEPT" if the given file is appropriately 
written in C- and "REJECT" otherwise, no additional files will be created 
in the proccess of the parsers execution. No special concerns exist 
regarding the parser at this time.

Project five is built into the parser built for project two. The program 
is invoked the same way and passed the same file, its output is now either 
intermediate code in quadruples or REJECT if the input file has incorrect 
syntax or invalid tokens. This program works by implicitly traversing the 
parse tree while parsing in order to generate the output.
